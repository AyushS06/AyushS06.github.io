               <p>Times have changed and increasingly we are finding people looking for new job opportunities.  No longer are people looking primarily at the newspaper want-ads to find their dream jobs. Job seekers are becoming more creative and utilizing new strategies in moving their careers forward. </p>

    <h2>Social Media</h2>
          <p>Networking can be done both in person and online. You can join professional associations, attend events for graduates of your school, or aim to connect with professionals who work in your field. Various online tools also exist, such as LinkedIn, which allow you to network with other professionals and learn about possible job openings.</p>

          <h2>Referrals</h2>
          <p>Referrals also come from individuals you know, however, this method may get you an invitation to apply for a position without actually searching for a new job. Some employers offer incentives to their employees for referring a successful candidate to their company – a win-win situation for everyone.</p>

          <h2>Online Job Search</h2>
          <p>Job boards were traditionally just that – boards posting vacancies and employment opportunities. Though some of these boards may still exist in a literal sense, many job boards have moved toward a virtual format. Often federal or state governments will provide job boards and job banks that job seekers can access. You can also use job search engines on the internet or the vast number of career-related websites that post job openings, such as Monster.com or CareerBuilder.com. </p>

          <h2>Company Websites</h2>
          <p>If you already have your dream employer in mind, why not go directly to the career section of their website? If you watch for openings on their site, there's a chance you'll find just the opportunity that you've been waiting for. Create a list of employers that you'd like to work for and visit their websites often</p>

          <h2>Temping or Internships</h2>
          <p>Sometimes temporary employment can lead to permanent positions. If you're without work, finding a temporary position with a great company is a great way to get a foot in the door, or provide you with useful business contacts to call upon in the future. Many recruitment agencies can assist with locating temporary or casual positions and contract work. Internships are a great choice for students who are just graduating from college and many schools' job placement services can connect students with opportunities. Volunteering can also be a great method for gaining valuable industry contacts.</p>

          <h2>Head Hunters and Recruitment Agencies</h2>
          <p>If you're looking for some professional help in your job search, head hunters and recruitment agencies can definitely lend a hand (though in some cases it may come at a price). There are a number of organizations that hire through recruitment agencies because it helps to streamline the lengthy process of locating and interviewing candidates. Head hunters locate individuals to fill a specific vacancy within an organization or find a position for a job seeker who has hired their services.</p>

           <p>Some companies test applicants for employment to determine if the candidate is a good match for the jobs they are hiring for. Companies who conduct pre-employment tests (talent assessments) are seeking applicants that match their hiring criteria. Review advice on taking employment tests, so you're prepared to respond to the employment-related questions you may be asked. Companies also may require drug tests for applicants for employment.</p>

             <p>Applicants who have researched the company they are applying to always make a good impression. Go beyond a cursory glance at their website: find out as much as possible about the organisation and its current projects, check the news for any issues facing the wider sector, and find out what competition the company has. You can also browse the company's social media channels. 
Work this knowledge into your application form by referring to it in your personal statement or responses to questions.

           <p>One section of the application form will typically ask you to list your entire academic and employment history. But when it comes to answering competency-based questions or writing a personal statement, it's up to you to pick and choose what to include.
It's vital that you read the job description and person specification carefully - it will outline exactly what skills and experience the employer is looking for and you should emphasise these in your application form. Give specific examples demonstrating when you have gained the experience or used the skill. Avoid being vague and don't waste space writing about skills you have that aren't relevant to the job.

             <p>Application forms can be dry documents and it's difficult to give an idea of what you're like as a person via an online form. Try to inject some personality into your answers.
Don't talk exclusively about your academic and employment history - find ways to include information about your other interests. For example, refer to extra-curricular activities that have helped you to gain the necessary skills for the job, and show that you can get along with a variety of different people.

           <p>In most cases your application form is the first chance potential employers have to get to know you, so don't miss the opportunity to sell yourself. This isn't the time to be too modest about your achievements. Include anything you feel is relevant to the role and makes you the right candidate for the job.
Talk about your passion for the role or the sector the organisation works in. Discuss the skills and experience you've gained during your degree, on internships and placements, in your part-time job, while doing voluntary work, at your university club or society, or while on a gap year. If you can relate it to the job requirements, then it's worth mentioning.

           <p>You need to come across as confident, so ensure that your answers are positive. For example, don't waffle as this may indicate that you're trying to cover up the fact that you lack a particular skill the employer is looking for. Instead, keep your answers short and to the point, explaining clearly how you meet the requirements of the role. </p>

    <h3>Resume Guidelines</h3>
          <ul class="list-group checked-list-box">
                  <li class="list-group-item" data-style="button" style="cursor: pointer;"><span class="state-icon glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Your resume should be as concise as possible; two pages is the maximum length, but one page is preferable. Here's more about resume length and how long your resume should be. If you need to get your resume on a single page, here's how to tighten it up and gain extra space.<input type="checkbox" class="hidden" ></li>
                  <li class="list-group-item" data-style="button" data-color="success" style="cursor: pointer;"><span class="state-icon glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Do not use ornate fonts that are difficult to read. Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, or a similar font is best. Your font size should be between 10 and 12 points although your name and the section headings can be a little larger and/or bold. Here's how to select a font for your resume.<input type="checkbox" class="hidden"></li>
                  <li class="list-group-item" data-style="button" data-color="info" style="cursor: pointer;"><span class="state-icon glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> The standard page margins in word processing programs (1" margins on the top, bottom and left and right sides of the page) work for most resumes. However, if you need to tighten the margins to reduce the length of your resume, it's fine to reduce the margins to a 1/2" on the sides and top and bottom.<input type="checkbox" class="hidden"></li>
                  <li class="list-group-item" data-style="button" data-color="warning" style="cursor: pointer;"><span class="state-icon glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> However you decide to organize the sections of your resume, be sure to keep each section uniform. For example, if you put the name of one company in italics, every company name must be in italics. If you bold one job title, bold them all.<input type="checkbox" class="hidden"></li>
                  <li class="list-group-item" data-style="button" data-color="danger" style="cursor: pointer;"><span class="state-icon glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Information to Avoid: Do not include personal information such as birthday, height, weight, marital status, children, etc., unless the position requires it.<input type="checkbox" class="hidden"></li>
      <li class="list-group-item" data-style="button" data-color="danger" style="cursor: pointer;"><span class="state-icon glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> Be sure to edit your resume before sending it. Check spelling, grammar, tenses, names of companies and people, etc. Have a friend or career services counselor check over your resume as well. Use this proofreading checklist to make sure your resume is perfect.<input type="checkbox" class="hidden"></li>
